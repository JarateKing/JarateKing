![github status](img/status.png)

My status is supposed to look like the above, but at some point Github broke rendering non-standard emojis in the status bar. As far as I'm aware I'm the only one who has a Github-custom emoji as a status, since they were never options in the frontend and the backend's been patched to disallow it since then.
