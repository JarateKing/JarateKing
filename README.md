Daily Contributions Streak: **3028** (2017-10-09 to 2026-01-23)

My status is supposed to look like ":godmode: :goberserk: :rage1: :rage4: :hurtrealbad: :finnadie: :feelsgood: :suspect:" but at some point Github broke rendering non-standard emojis in the status bar. As far as I'm aware I'm the only one who has a Github-custom emoji as a status, since they were never options in the frontend and the backend's been patched to disallow it since then.
